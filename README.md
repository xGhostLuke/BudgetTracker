Technical Stack
Frontend:

    HTML/CSS: Build the structure and style of your app.
    JavaScript: Add interactivity (e.g., form validations, dynamic charts, real-time budget updates).
        Use a library like Chart.js for creating visualizations.

Backend:

    Python or Java: Create a REST API to handle user data, budgets, and expenses.
        If you use Python, frameworks like Flask or Django are great.
        If you prefer Java, use Spring Boot.

Database:

    Use SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing user data, budgets, and expenses.

Optional Extras:

    If you know C#, you can build this as a desktop app using WPF or WinForms.
    Create a mobile app version using React Native or Flutter.

Example Workflow

    User Flow
        User logs in and sets up their budget for the month.
        They enter their income and expenses daily.
        They check reports to see if they’re on track to meet their savings goal.

    Backend Workflow
        User data is stored securely in a database.
        APIs fetch, calculate, and return budget data to the frontend.

    Frontend Flow
        Dynamic UI updates show real-time progress against the user’s budget.
        Charts visualize spending patterns.

Learning Outcomes

    Frontend-Backend Integration: Learn how to make your frontend and backend communicate effectively via APIs.
    Data Visualization: Gain experience using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for creating visual insights.
    Authentication: Implement secure user authentication to protect sensitive data.
    Practical CSS: Build a clean, responsive UI that’s intuitive to use.
